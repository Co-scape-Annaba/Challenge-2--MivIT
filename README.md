# Challenge-2--MivIT
# Overview
In our work, we meticulously considered key factors for effective visualization, including data type (numerical), and the psychology of colors. Additionally, we adhered to the principles of data visualization, aiming to fulfill the 7 goals such as illustrating changes over time, comparing values, and showing part-to-whole composition.

## Visualization of Monthly Earnings Over All Years
When visualizing monthly earnings over multiple years, we focused on numerical data while aiming to depict changes over time and enable easy comparison of values. To achieve this, we opted for a combination of a Vertical Bar Chart and a Line Chart. We further enhanced the interpretability of the visualization by sorting the data in descending order, allowing users to readily identify the highest and lowest income months over the years.

## Interactive Visualization - Enabling User to Choose a Particular Store
We enhanced our previous visualization by making it interactive, allowing users to dynamically select a specific store from a dropdown menu. This user input dynamically updates the visualization, providing insights tailored to the selected store.

## Extra Visualization - Donut Chart
Incorporating a Donut Chart adds value by illustrating part-to-whole composition, enabling viewers to discern the contribution of each month to the total earnings effectively.

## Colors
For our visualizations, we utilized the Walmart palette colors to ensure aesthetic appeal and consistency. The Walmart color brand palette consists of two primary colors: '#0071ce' and '#ffc220'.

# Conclusion
By leveraging effective visualization techniques and thoughtful color choices, our visualizations provide valuable insights into the monthly earnings of various stores. Whether analyzing changes over time, comparing values, or understanding part-to-whole relationships, our visualizations offer actionable insights to drive informed decision-making.
